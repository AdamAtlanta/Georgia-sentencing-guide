### 7. Drug Trafficking (O.C.G.A. § 16-13-31)

**Status:** ⚠️ **COMPLEX - Recent Legal Changes**

**Traditional Rule:**
- "adjudication of guilt or imposition of sentence shall not be suspended, probated, deferred, or withheld prior to serving the mandatory minimum"
- Mandatory minimums were absolute (e.g., 5 years for 10-2000 lbs marijuana)

**Recent Development - Roundtree Case:**
- Georgia Court of Appeals held that O.C.G.A. § 16-13-31 says defendants "shall be imprisoned" but doesn't explicitly prohibit probation like serious violent felony statute
- **Result:** Judges may potentially probate a PORTION of the sentence
- Example: 10-year mandatory minimum could become 5 years prison + 5 years probation

**Exception (Always Available):**
- **Substantial Assistance:** District attorney can move for reduced/suspended sentence if defendant helps identify, arrest, or convict accomplices

**Recommendation for Database:**
- Note that mandatory minimums apply
- Add caveat about Roundtree case allowing potential probation of portions
- Mention substantial assistance exception

**Mandatory Minimums by Drug:**
- **Marijuana:** 5 years (10-2000 lbs), 7 years (2000-10000 lbs), 15 years (10000+ lbs)
- **Cocaine:** 10 years (28-200g), 15 years (200-400g), 25 years (400g+)
- **Methamphetamine:** 10 years (28-200g), 15 years (200-400g), 25 years (400g+)
- **Heroin/Opioids:** 5 years (4-14g), 10 years (14-28g), 25 years (28g+)
- **Fentanyl:** 10 years (4-8g), 15 years (8-28g), 35 years to Life (28g+)
